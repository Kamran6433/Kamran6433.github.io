            Newcastle University Pakistan Society was established in September 2015 to provide Pakistani students a platform through which to raise awareness about Pakistan and promote its rich cultural heritage. Celebrating our culturally significant events and celebrations in a unique manner means that the Pakistan Society (PakSoc) is the voice of Pakistan at Newcastle University.
            The society hosts multiple social and cultural events throughout the year to bring together the Pakistani community on campus. Through our efforts, we intend to create a platform by which the Pakistani community at Newcastle University can bond and represent itself to the wider campus and outside community. For the first time ever, we will be holding an annual daastan ball! As well as this, we will also be hosting regular social and traditional events including day trips, cricket matches, movie screenings, bowling, games night, Qawwali night, and our most loved event: chai nâ€™ chill.
